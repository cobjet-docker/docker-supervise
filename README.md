docker-supervise
================

Monitors containers via name and automatically restarts those that die.

Building:

It is probably a good idea to use `go get -u` to retrieve this package, as it also downloads all the necessary dependencies to build it.

Usage:

`DOCKER_HOST`: path to docker socket/port/etc

HTTP API:

* `GET /` list of containers being monitored (JSON array of container names)
* `POST /` takes 'id':'[id or name]', and begins to monitor it
* `GET /{id or name}` get configuration of container (404 if not monitored)
* `DELETE /{id or name}` do not monitor this container anymore

OS X Users:
